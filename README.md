# 📚 What I Learn Through Data Structures  

Welcome to **"What I Learn Through Data Structures"** — my personal journey to master Data Structures in a **fun & engaging way** 🎮.  
Instead of the usual textbook style, I’ll be learning and sharing concepts **in game-format code** — because learning should be exciting, not boring!  

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Series
- Learn **core data structures** (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more)  
- Understand **how they work under the hood**  
- Build **mini-games or game-like simulations** for each concept  
- Share **code + explanations** so anyone can follow along

---

## 🕹️ How It Works
Each data structure will be represented **as part of a game**:
- **Array** → Inventory system in a game  
- **Stack** → Undo/Redo actions  
- **Queue** → Player turn system  
- **Linked List** → Character movement chain  
- **Tree** → Game decision-making (AI)  
- **Graph** → Map navigation  

Every post in this series will include:
1. **Concept Explanation** (in simple words)
2. **Game-style Implementation Code**
3. **Output & Visualization**
4. **Key Takeaways**

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
